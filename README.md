# p-wage-control
Code from Wage control app from Jemenes Dev.

This project has been realized using a multi-layer architecture. The presentation layer has been done with MVC and using Thymeleaf.
The business layer has been realized with Spring and the data layer with Spring (JPA and Hibernate) and using PostgreSQL.
For the view I wanted to have the constraint of only using Bootstrap to learn how to use it in depth.
